# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe game written in vue using vuex to store state.

## Get Started

You'd better have `node >=10` and `npm >=6` installed:

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Folder Structure

```bash
├── dist                    # directory which contains all bundled files
│    ├── build.js           # bundle js files
│    └── build.js.map       # bundle js map files
├── src                     # source code file
│    ├── components         # All the components of the projects that are not the main views
│    └── store              # directory which contains vuex file like state, actions or mutations
│    └── App.vue            # main app views files
│    └── main.js            #  main js files
